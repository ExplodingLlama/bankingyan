      Human Resource Strength at Scheduled Commercial Banks in India as on March 2018 was around 14
    Lakh Employees at different levels. Scheduled Commercial Banks include 21 Public Sector Banks
    (excluding RRBs) and equal number of Private Domestic Banks. Around 45 Foreign Banks have
    branches in India. In addition, ten Small Finance Banks were also operational as on 31 st March 2018.
    Scheduled Commercial Banks had over 120000 branches as on 31 st March 2018.
    Unprecedent increase in volumes of transactions and increased use of technology has resulted in
    automated processes, templated products and need for lesser customer interaction. This has
    resulted in lesser compulsion for senior management of banks to give emphasis on enhancing
    fundamental knowledge and analytical skills amongst employees. Functional training programs of
    banks focus more on “What” and “How” of Banking processes and less and less on “Why” of various
    aspects of banking.
    For taking up bigger roles in Banking, one of the biggest challenges faced by employees is to
    continuously upgrade their knowledge and skills in banking. They need to keep pace with the
    changes in various regulations, rules about the areas including General Banking, Credit
    Management, Foreign Exchange and International Banking, Risk Management, Legal and Regulatory
    Aspects of Banking, General Economic Environment, Payments and Settlement Systems, Digital
    Banking, etc.
    To understand changing expectations and needs of the customers, employees must be thorough
    about product knowledge, tax implications and comparative analysis of different offerings so that
    interaction with customers is more profitable for both Bank and the Customer. Employees need to
    be aware of impact of policy decisions by Government and Central Bank as also about effect of
    various economic indicators like CAD, Fiscal Deficit, GDP, Inflation, Interest Rates etc.
    Through the launch of the website bankingyan.com, an attempt will be made to provide updated
    knowledge on different areas of Banking. It is proposed to provide quality reading material, latest
    banking news and updates, tools to develop skill sets and critical analysis of various policy decisions.
    It is also planned to provide comparative analysis of different banks with respect to Size,
    Profitability, Asset Quality and Operating Efficiency.
    This website is the brainchild of a highly qualified banker with four decades of experience in Banking
    – both in Public Sector as well as New Generation Private Sector Banks, of which nearly two decades
    experience is in the Learning and Development functions of Banks.
